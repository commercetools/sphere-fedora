SPHERE.IO - Fedora
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/commercetools/sphere-fedora.png)](https://travis-ci.org/commercetools/sphere-fedora)

This is a fully functional example web store for the [SPHERE.IO](http://sphere.io) PaaS.

If you are looking for a template built using the new [SPHERE JVM SDK](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-jvm-sdk) please have a look at [Sunrise](https://github.com/spherio/sphere-sunrise) instead.
